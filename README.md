The **Crypto Risk Toolkit** is a Python-based script for managing cryptocurrency price data for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, it also analyzes some basic market risk metrics, and portfolio risk. It includes tools to calculate:

- Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) volatility and covariance
- Parametric and historical Value at Risk (VaR)
- Stress test impacts
- Portfolio expected return and volatility

Price data is sourced directly from Binance and stored locally using **SQLite** for simplicity and portability.

A lightweight **Django web app** (`myapp`) is included to visualize the analysis results and serve a basic front end for exploring portfolio risk metrics.

Ideal for crypto traders, analysts, and developers interested in quantifying and monitoring the risk of portfolios comprised of one of those 3 crypto-currencies.
The code can be further modified to include any currency available in `ccxt` package
